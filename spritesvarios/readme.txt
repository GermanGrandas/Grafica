 Firebird Tileset 
--------------------------

Thank you for choosing the Firebird tileset!

“Firebird” is the name given to a custom tileset project by myself (Supindahood), Linkus and Shiek. 
The basic idea was to create a tileset as easy to use as the GB Zelda tilesets and as visually appealing as the tMC aesthetics. 
After many months of hard work we present you the first official Firebird release!

Overview of the tileset and its features


	* Simple tile usage and clean visuals
	* User friendly, not layer heavy
	* Large collection of tiles and well organized sheets
	* Almost 100% custom sprites
	* More than 30 palettes for both interior and overworld
	* Sprites for all items plus custom items
	* Even more goodies you'll find inside!
